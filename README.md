# ml-heart_beat-ecg

## Machine Learning for ECG Heartbeat Classification

This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based system to classify ECG (electrocardiogram) heartbeats** into normal and abnormal categories. It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

##  Project Overview

An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart. Abnormal heartbeat patterns may indicate arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions. Automating ECG analysis using machine learning helps in **early detection and decision support**, reducing dependency on manual interpretation.

This project:
- Processes ECG heartbeat time-series data
- Extracts meaningful features
- Trains ML models for classification
- Evaluates model performance
- Saves trained models for inference
